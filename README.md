# Convex Optimization Journey

---

## Introduction

Welcome to my repository documenting my learning journey through Stanford's EE364a: **Convex Optimization I**. Here, I'm sharing my progress, homework solutions, and insights gained along the way.

## Background

I'm an ambitious first-year student passionate about quantum computing. Recently, I approached a professor specializing in quantum computing to discuss possible collaboration opportunities. They agreed and tasked me with modeling quantum states using semidefinite programming over the summer.

Since my university does not currently offer a course specifically on convex optimization, I searched online and discovered the outstanding [Stanford EE364a course](https://stanford.edu/class/ee364a/) taught by Stephen Boyd. I created this repository to structure my learning, document my progress, and share this exciting journey.

## Learning Materials

I'll primarily use two excellent resources freely available from Stanford:

- [Lecture Videos (2023)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rMJqxxviPa4AmDClvcbHi6h)
- [*Convex Optimization* textbook](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) by Boyd and Vandenberghe

This repository mainly features solutions to textbook exercises. My goal is to complete all exercises listed on the [original course website](https://see.stanford.edu/Course/EE364A), focusing especially on the most challenging problems, as these provide the greatest learning opportunities. Additionally, I'll tackle supplementary exercises from Professor Boyd’s [additional exercises repository](https://github.com/cvxgrp/cvxbook_additional_exercises/blob/main/additional_exercises.pdf).

**Note**: While I strive for accuracy, please approach my solutions critically—I’m still learning, and mistakes will happen!

## Collaboration & Feedback

If you find my work helpful or interesting, please feel free to reference it. I'm always eager to support others who are learning convex optimization.

I would also greatly appreciate it if you pointed out any mistakes or suggested improvements. Feedback is warmly welcomed—please share via GitHub Issues or email me directly at the address linked to my GitHub profile.

Thank you for visiting!
